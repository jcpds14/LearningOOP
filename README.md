One parte of my studies about OOP with C# language

The OOP paradigm has 4 concepts

_Abstration_
It is the concept of using <strong> just the essential </strong> information for your system and fill in the classes with this information.

_Encapsulation_
It is the concept that makes a certain private property, so that it cannot be accessed by anyone but the class itself

_Herança_
It is the concept where children inherit the characteristics of a particular class

_Polimorfismo_
Com o polimorfismo, podemos sobrescrever métodos das classes filhas para que se comportem de maneira diferente e ter sua própria implementação.
