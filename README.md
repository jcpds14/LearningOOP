One parte of my studies about OOP with C# language

The OOP paradigm has 4 concepts

_Abstration_
It is the concept of using <strong> just the essential </strong> information for your system and fill in the classes with this information.

_Encapsulation_
It is the concept that makes a certain private property, so that it cannot be accessed by anyone but the class itself

_Heran√ßa_
It is the concept where children inherit the characteristics of a particular class

_Polymorphism_
With polymorphism, we can stand out for the daughters' methods to behave differently and have their own implementation.
